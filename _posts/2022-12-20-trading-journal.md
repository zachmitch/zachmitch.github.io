Thoughts: Japan did something overnight that caused a down move to like 3800, but has recovered strongly.  According to Hedgeye, "Essentially the BOJâ€™s Kuroda decided to have a Catchup Day with Global Cost of Capital. He moved his goal-posts on the 10yr Japanese Government Bond Yield from 0.25% to 0.50%."  This did 3 things:  rallied Yen/Dollar, dropped the Nikkei, drove sovereign bond yields higher (including UST's).  

Still in negative gamma and I have a short bias for the market, but unless we are crashing we can't keep going down in this orderly way.  We will trap shorts and then shoot up, much more likely.  The VIX/SPX both going down yesterday also makes me think we are going up ST.  Given the ivol premium, if still available at a good price and market not crashing, I'll find some more XLP longs to catch a positive move up.

Thoughts:  

Took another QQQ long runner that paid off well, still down overall on that strategy over the past week.  Selling was hitting an overnight zone and it wasn't strong (and we've extended to the downside for quite a while now), so expected SOME sort of a bounce.  Bought 100 PCT (cheap) for LT as they finished their first factory early -- according to Mike T this is a 40x over tail duration, so I'll leg in when I see opps.  Got some bonds for LT hold as this COULD be a bottom as gold is signalling lower yields from here (by not going down).  Sold my short dated WMT option on the pop, still carrying another for Feb.  Around 8, it was looking like we may have a trend day, so took another short-dated long QQQ.  I was wrong and sold immediately once it broke 3860.  Took a break in D period to do some studying.
