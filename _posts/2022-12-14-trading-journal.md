## Morning Work


**Portfolio**

Beta weighted to SPX: -8.72

USD: 14%

Major positions:  <span style="color:green">PLBY, MSOS, OSTK</span><span style="color:red">  MPW, META, MSFT</span>

Thoughts: SPX trading like a penny stock.  No buying retention, up and down.  Attempting zen as noone knows how today will go with FOMC, and I am short as I expect some fear into the run up to the FED speech or afterward -- Could also be blown out if he's dovish.  I think he will keep rates higher for longer as he has said many times.  McConnell has said he'll block all MJ legislation (perhaps explaining MSOS failure).  Looks like USD and short bonds would be the macro moves according to HE today.  TSLA oversold, while the rest of tech you should be selling soon (treasury yields) -- doesn't look good for them.

Thoughts:

Came in with a bearish bias and market started going up (not surprised).  Handled it poorly first two hours, scaled into 402p's 1DTE, looked like shorts trapped so not wanting to be one of them, I sold my long puts for small loss when we hit vwap (net loss of $30, so fine with it).  Closed some GPS puts that I bought yesterday trying to get closer to even into FOMC.  Turns out I should have held, but I think I made the safe move considering I was pretty bearishly positioned overall.  After FOMC I covered some shorts on the down move as I expect a small bounce into/out of OpEx and they'll run some shorts out for sure.  Really good day overall, +386 bps (but there is much money on the table with MPW).  I go into overnight -4.1 beta weighted to SPX.
